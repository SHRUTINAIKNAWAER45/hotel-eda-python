Exploratory Data Analysis of hotel booking data using Python to analyze occupancy, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

Hotel Revenue & Occupancy Analysis (Python EDA)

--Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand revenue, occupancy trends, and customer behavior across different cities, room categories, and time periods. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can help hotels improve pricing strategy, demand forecasting, and overall performance.

🗂 Data Used

Multiple datasets were used in this project, including:

Hotel details

Booking data

Room type information

Calendar data

These datasets were merged and cleaned to create a single analytical dataset for analysis.

🔧 What Was Done

Using Python, I performed:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values and incorrect data types

Merging datasets for complete analysis

Creating new metrics such as Occupancy Percentage

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations

📊 Key Analysis

The following insights were explored:

City-wise occupancy and demand

Room class performance

Weekday vs weekend booking patterns

High-performing and low-performing hotels

Revenue and utilization trends

🔍 Key Findings

Some cities consistently showed higher occupancy and demand

Weekend bookings were higher than weekday bookings

Certain room classes had high revenue but lower occupancy, indicating pricing optimization opportunities

A few hotels showed low occupancy and customer ratings, suggesting the need for service improvement

💼 Business Value

This analysis helps hotel management to:

Improve pricing and promotional strategies

Optimize room utilization

Identify high-demand segments

Focus on underperforming hotels for improvement

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
